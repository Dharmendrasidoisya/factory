                        <p>
                            Advertising with Google allows you to reach new customers at the precise moment they’re
                            searching for your type of products and services. You can choose to be charged for
                            clicks, impressions, or conversions, depending on the type of campaign you run.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once your ads are running, we provide performance data so your third-party partner can
                            track what’s working and what’s not. Google’s AdWords and AdWords Express advertising
                            products are highly accountable, helping you understand precisely the return on your
                            advertising investment and allowing your third-party partner to make adjustments to
                            optimize for the best possible return. For a summary of the differences between AdWords
                            and AdWords Express see <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/express/answer/1689628?hl=en" target="_blank">support.google.com/adwords/express/answer/1689628</a>

                            In addition to Google search, you can also run ads on Google’s network of partner sites
                            (places where you may have seen the “Ads by Google” message) – including YouTube. On this
                            network, you can take advantage of other ad formats, such as image ads and video ads.

                            We believe that Google advertising can help your business succeed. However, you might not
                            have the time or resources to devote to building – and regularly maintaining – a
                            successful account. Or maybe you’d just like some help optimizing from an expert.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That’s where our third-party partners come in. There are many different types of third
                            parties out there, from the largest advertising agency and yellow page publisher to the
                            one-person web consultant. To help you select a third-party partner, we’ve developed our
                            Partner Programs. Participating third parties that have met the requirements of one of
                            our Partner Programs may display that program’s badge on their websites. Two badges that
                            you’ll probably see most often are <a href="https://www.google.com/partners/?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Partner</a> and <a href="https://www.google.co.in/ads/premiersmbpartner/" target="_blank">Premier SMB Partners</a>.

                            To confirm that a company is certified within our Partner Programs, click the badge on
                            its website. If the company is certified, you’ll be taken to its profile page on Google.

                        <p>
                            A third-party partner can save you and your business a lot of time and energy. For best
                            results, we encourage you to stay informed, involved, and up-to-speed on your ad
                            campaigns, and let your partner handle the time-consuming work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Third-party partners will often charge a fee in addition to the cost of your advertising.
                            Remember, they provide valuable services like managing your campaigns, providing you with
                            reporting, answering your questions, or optimizing your campaigns. We believe it’s
                            important for you to understand the total cost of your advertising, including any fees
                            your third-party partner charges. You can use this amount to determine your return on
                            investment (ROI).

                                <strong>Be selective.</strong> When selecting a third-party partner to work with, look
                                for companies that display a Google Partner or a Premier SMB Partners badge. You can
                                use <a href="https://www.google.com/partners/?hl=en#a_search" target="_blank">

                                understand and are comfortable with the length of the contract you’re entering into
                                with the partner. There are a few other criteria to help you choose the right
                                third-party partner for you:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Has this third-party partner worked with businesses in your area before?
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        What about businesses with similar budgets or target audiences?

                                        What other services can they provide – alongside Google advertising – to grow
                                        your business?

                                <strong>Pick one partner.</strong> You may be tempted to divide your budget among
                                multiple third parties to see which one drives the best results. You’re welcome to do
                                this, but we recommend that you test them one at a time. Google doesn’t display more
                                than one ad for a business on a page of search results, so you’ll find it difficult to
                                test multiple third parties at once.
                            </li>

                                <strong>Educate yourself.</strong> Understanding advertising at an advanced level can
                                take time, but it doesn’t take much time to learn the basics of Google advertising.
                                Review the "Advertising basics" section below. To learn more, visit the AdWords Help

                                <strong>Trust experience.</strong> If you’re working with a company that’s managed
                                hundreds of Google advertising accounts, then it’s likely to have developed expertise
                                with Google’s advertising products. If it tells you that certain industries have
                                historically higher online-advertising costs or certain keywords or ads might not work
                                for your business, it’s probably speaking from experience.

                                <strong>Evaluate your performance.</strong> Unless you’re focused on branding, what
                                matters most about advertising is the return on your investment in it (i.e. the number
                                of new customers coming in the door). So take some time each month to measure what
                                you’re investing, and the results you’re receiving from that investment.

                                achieve your desired ad placement, but those that guarantee a specific position (i.e.
                                the top position every time a user searches for your keyword) are misrepresenting how

                                <strong>Average Position:</strong> The average position an ad appears in when it's
                                triggered. An average position of 1-8 generally means that the ad is appearing on the
                                first page of search results.
                            </li>

                                <strong>Clickthrough Rate (CTR):</strong> The number of clicks divided by the number of
                                impressions, shown as a percentage. A good CTR can improve your average position.

                                <strong>Conversion:</strong> The action that your advertising results in, such as a
                                phone call, lead, or sale. This is usually a good metric to use to measure the success
                                of your advertising.

                                <strong>Keywords:</strong> The words or phrases you select for AdWords so that when
                                users search for those words on Google, your ad may appear next to or above the search
                                results. For AdWords Express, Google automatically selects keywords based on your short
                                ad and product description; you do not choose the keywords.
                            </li>
